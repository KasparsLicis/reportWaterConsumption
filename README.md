Script provides automatic consumption reporting to RÄ«gas namsaimnieks web portal

Script is designed to login to the portal (https://e-parvaldnieks.lv/), read previous consumption, add defined consumption and submit the results.
Script is designed because I usually forgot to do this task on time.

Script is using python, selenium and Firefox as browser.
